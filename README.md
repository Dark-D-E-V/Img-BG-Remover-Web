# Image Background Remover Web Application

## A fully functional Web Application written in Python that removes the Background of a Image Using AI.

This is a fun project of mine. In this project i have created a fully functional Web Application that removes the background of any image using AI Model. I have used Python for this project. Anyone can use this project for fun and learn something new.

## About This Project
My Goal was to reverse engineer the `https://www.remove.bg/` website. In My project , I Used and AI model "U2NET" that detect the Image Subject and remove the background. Note that this model is not perfect. And i used Flask for the Web interface.

## Expectations for the contributor's

I have made the model as good as possible. I got help from other senior programer's. But This model is still not have full accuracy. I expect from my fellow contributor's to update the model and make it as powerful as possible and make it a good AI project.

### For those who don't know Matching Learning

If You don't know matching learning for AI, it's fine. You can still contribute to the Web Interface. Thank You
